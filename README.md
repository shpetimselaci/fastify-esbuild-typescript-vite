# Boilerplate for Fastify + Typescript + esbuilt + Vite + Eslint + Prettier

This boilerplate has the intention to increase the speed of creating a Backend API setup, using all the fastest tools available at the moment.

It has prettier enabled by default in VSCode, so everything is always formatted.

Node version: 16.4.0
npm version: 6.14.15

To set up the backend, first install dependencies:

```js
npm run install // or npm i
```

To run the server:

```js
npm run dev // or npm i
```

To build the server:

```js
npm run build // creates a minified file to build/index.js
```

To run tests:

```js
npm run  test // or npm run coverage
```

To lint files:

```js
npm run install // or npm i
```
